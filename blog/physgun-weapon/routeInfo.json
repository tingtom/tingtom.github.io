While testing the code I also found out a way to get the original beam code working so this also includes that, back when I first worked on it the beam was replaced with a serverside straight beam to the object.</p>\n<p>The source code is available <a href=\"%22https://gist.github.com/tingtom/47ef360d3183b41676e2552c8193bb1f%22\">here</a>, there&#39;s no need to edit the c_weapon__stubs_hl2 file like other weapons since the weapon declares itself you just need add the physgun.cpp file to the server project and the c_weapon_gravitygun.cpp file to the client project.</p>\n<p>Video of the weapon:</p>\n<iframe style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OEVRGoE1T7o?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},"path":"blog/physgun-weapon"}
